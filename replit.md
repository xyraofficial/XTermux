# Replit.md

## Overview

This appears to be a new or empty repository with no existing code structure. The project has not yet been initialized with any specific framework, language, or architecture. This provides a blank slate for development where architectural decisions can be made from scratch based on project requirements.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

No architecture has been established yet. When building out this project, consider the following common patterns:

### Frontend Options
- **React/Next.js** - For complex, interactive web applications with server-side rendering needs
- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** - For simple static sites or learning projects
- **Vue/Svelte** - For reactive UIs with simpler learning curves

### Backend Options
- **Node.js/Express** - JavaScript-based server, good for full-stack JS projects
- **Python/Flask/FastAPI** - Good for data-heavy applications or ML integrations
- **Serverless Functions** - For lightweight APIs without managing servers

### Data Storage Options
- **SQLite** - Simple file-based database, good for small projects
- **PostgreSQL** - Robust relational database for production applications
- **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe ORM that works with multiple database backends

### Design Patterns to Consider
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** - Separation of concerns for maintainability
- **API-first design** - Build backend APIs before frontend for flexibility
- **Component-based architecture** - Reusable UI components for consistency
